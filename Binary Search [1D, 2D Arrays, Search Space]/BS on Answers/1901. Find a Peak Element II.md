# 1901. Find a Peak Element II

A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

 

Example 1:

see image on leetcode

Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
Example 2:

see image on leetcode

Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 500
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105
No two adjacent cells are equal.

        int rows = mat.size();
        int cols = mat[0].size();
        int row = 0;
        int col = 0;

        while(true){
            int currEle = mat[row][col];
            if(col-1 >= 0 && currEle < mat[row][col-1]){
                col = col-1;
            }
            else if(col+1 < cols && currEle < mat[row][col+1]){
                col = col+1;

            else if(row-1 >= 0 && currEle < mat[row-1][col]){
                row = row -1;
            }
            else if(row+1 < rows && currEle < mat[row+1][col]){
                row = row +1;
